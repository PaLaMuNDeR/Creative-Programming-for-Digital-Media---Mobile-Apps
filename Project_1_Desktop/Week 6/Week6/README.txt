Welcome to this, the final lesson pack. 

We have a bumper selection of code for you this week, from the almost elegant through to the very hacky. But - you should be able to get a home brew drum machine and synths running on your mobile device. 

A few notes:

We developed the audio API specifically for this course; as such it is still under development. Our aim is for total consistency across platforms, but for now, there are a few features missing on the Java versions (Android, Desktop), i.e. filter envelopes and the delay unit. We just haven't had time to implement these yet. And the filter is not quite as good as that one in the Web Audio API (tell us the coeffs, Chris...). 

It is worth noting that the Web Audio API is now available in beta versions of mobile Chrome for Android, but it is early days for that right now. 

You are free to submit bug reports, fork our API, make it better, make a new one, all that stuff, right here:

Thanks and we hope to see you over our shoulders again soon.
